What is a Gitrepository?
Gitrepository is a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and/or directories.It stores the set of a file as well as the history of changes made to those files. It is great for collaborating with others. Since it saves the history of changes that have been made to that file it is useful because you can always go back to the original if you donâ€™t like the change that has been made.

What are the 2 special features of a Gitrepository?
-it allows you to work together with your teammates in the same file.
-saves the changes that have been made therefor if you have made a change that you don't like and would like to go back you go to the history undo the change. 

Why or how do those features help your collaborative project?
These features allows my group to ge the appropriate info needed in the website, without having the trouble of asking the teamates for the current work we are at.
